          <h2 class="main-heading">Background + About Me</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-text">I was born in Boise, ID and spent the first 18 years of my life there. Once I graduated from high school, I studied sociology at the University of Idaho in Moscow, ID. After graduating, I moved to Portland with the intention of attending law school in 2018. After working as a legal assistant for a few months, I abandoned these ambitions and enrolled at Epicodus in hopes of pursuing a career in web development.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-text">Studying sociology has helped me establish a passion for advocacy, justice, and activism. <span class="strong">I hope to eventually merge this background with my interest in coding by supporting nonprofit organizations and community interests.</span></p>
